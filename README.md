MyQLM interface for for the qoqo quantum toolkit by [HQS Quantum Simulations](https://quantumsimulations.de).

_General_

qoqo-myqlm provides the interface to the Atos MyQLM software.
MyQLM is under the myQLM license ( see https://myqlm.github.io/myqlm_specific/license.html for further infomation).
qoqo-myqlm itself is provided under the Apache-2.0 license but can only be used after installing myQLM and agreeing to the myQLM license.

_Testing_

Due to the myQLM license we are limited in the automatic code quality checks we can perform for qoqo-myqlm. If you find unexpected behaviour please open a github issue. You can also run the pytests in qoqo_myqlm/tests/ locally.

This software is still in the beta stage. Functions and documentation are not yet complete and breaking changes can occur.
